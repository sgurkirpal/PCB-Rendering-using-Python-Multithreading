# PCB Rendering using Python Multithreading

- Generating PCB images. (Colors- White, Black, Red, Blue, Green).
- I have used the gerber library to render the PCB layers.
- All the five images are generated at the same time using multithreading in python.


# PCB Color
The color of PCB defines the color of the solder oil or solder mask. It consists of lacquer impregnated with pigments that are known for protecting the traces of bare copper. Made from glass â€“ epoxy, the finishing color of PCB is representing the solder mask. One of the main applications of the solder mask is prevention against the short-circuiting of the circuit board.
